| 2026-02-17 11:30 | Bro (Researcher) | MoE Study: Immediate Alpha | Identified **Reg SHO Threshold List** as the only current structural catalyst. ETFs like MSTX, PLTU, and MSFU are currently on the list. |
| 2026-02-17 11:35 | QA (Tester) | Logic Audit: Reg SHO/iNAV/SPAC | **CRITICAL:** iNAV arb is invalidated by "IEX Ghosts" (stale data). SPAC Arb is too manual for Paper environment. Reg SHO is a "weighted squeeze," not an arb. |
| 2026-02-17 11:40 | MoE Synthesis | Final Verdict | Shorter-term alpha (48h) is **probabilistic**, not deterministic. **No 1.0 Certainty candidates found.** |
| 2026-02-17 11:55 | Bro (Researcher) | MoE Update: Options Arb | Identified **SPX Box Spreads** as a 1.0 certainty, but **Alpaca lacks SPX options**. SPY boxes are too inefficient for retail. |
| 2026-02-17 12:00 | QA (Tester) | Options Logic Audit | **DANGER:** Paper trading fills options at the Mid-price. Most "deterministic" 1.0 arbs in paper are **Simulation Phantoms**—non-executable in the real world due to bid/ask spreads and HTB fees. |
